Creates red rotating square and purple moving triangle using button, slider, menu, and key presses.
Used example code 10 (RotatingSquareAndStationaryTriangleExercise) as starter code


Known issues:
-The change direction button/menu option act strange until slider is used. Slider seems to reset it and fixes lots of weird problems. I think I went wrong in the change direction code, but I got it somewhat functional and didn't want to mess with it any more in case I couldn't get it working again on time.
-Slider makes speed faster the father left it is, which is opposite of intuitive norm of farther right = more speed
-Triangle resets to center when switching from left to right. For example, pressing "A A A D" will have end result
being triangle is 1 move to the right instead of two to the left. This is somewhat intentional, as I know why it is happening, I just finally got it all working and did not want to try messing with it any more.

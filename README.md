Creates red rotating square and purple moving triangle using button, slider, menu, and key presses.
Used example code 10 (RotatingSquareAndStationaryTriangleExercise) as starter code


Known issues:

-Triangle resets to center when switching from left to right. For example, pressing "A A A D" (left left left right) will have the end result of triangle being shifted 1 to the right instead of two to the left. This is somewhat intentional, as I know why it is happening, I just finally got it all working and did not want to try messing with it any more.
